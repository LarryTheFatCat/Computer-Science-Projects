    f"Hey guys, my name is {name} and I am currently in grade {grade}. "
    + f"Yesterday, there was a spider in the classroom that made me yell {favourite_exclamation} whiile I was taking a math test with my {least_favourite_colour} pen :/ "
    + f"One of the questions on the test was wether or not I thought Elvis was cool, so I obviously put {is_cool} to get the answer right... "
    + f"Turns out that I only scored a {math_test_score} on the test. One of the qusetions was asking me to write the equation for a line "
    + f"with a slope of {slope} and a y-intercept of {y_intercept} so I wrote y = {slope}x + {y_intercept}, but I did not notice the x value of {x} in the question "
    + f"so I needed to, on the next line, say that the value of y was {y}. "
    + f"I told my sister {sister_name} about this and she just laughed at me "
    + "Anyway, that's the story of my math test."
    + f"Though on Friday I recieved my first semester report card and it turns out my accounting mark went from a 93% to a {accounting_mark}% which I am really mad about, and "
    + f"I checked my overall average for the first semester classes that I have it shows that I have an {first_sem_avg}% overall which I am really happy about. "
    + f"After that I took a nap and woke up to my cat trying to eat my leg, his name is {cat_name} and he is very fat! "
    + "Anyways that's the story about my class marks and my fat cat named Larry!"
